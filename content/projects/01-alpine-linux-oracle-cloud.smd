## Motivation

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I recently decided I wanted to host a simple static website with write-ups
about my projects. The main motivation for this is to help me actually finish
what I start - Bring a project to completion is much less appealing than
starting a new one, and so the pile of old ideas, git repositories, 3D models
and parts only grows.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ideally, the website should cost as little as possible. There are many options
for free static site hosting, the seemingly most common one being GitHub pages.
However, I like the added flexibility of a dedicated VPS. It could later be
expanded to allow comments under the posts (a functionality I would like to add
at some point) and the added cost is actually *zero*.

## Oracle Cloude Free Tier
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Oracle offers free VPSs with up to 4 vCPUs and 24 GiB of RAM. This is more than
adequate for a simple website like this. However, Oracle's management interface
leaves quite a bit to be desired. Most notably, using custom Linux images is
locked behind a paid tier.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
That said, there is still hope. The boot partitions on the system images
offered by Oracle are large enough to be overwritten with a minimalist Linux
ISO. On the next boot, the system runs entirely from RAM and the boot disk
is available for traditional reformatting. This way it should be possible to
install any distribution on the system, although if the desired ISO is larger
than the boot partition, an intermediate step may be required.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I opted not to bother with that and just use Alpine Linux, the minimalist
distro in question. One of the main selling points of Alpine is increased
security, which is a nice bonus for a public-facing server. It is also
possible to avoid using sshd by connecting to the server using OCI's
Cloud Shell service.
